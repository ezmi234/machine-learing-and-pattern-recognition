### Theory - question 1 

Describe the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) approach for dimensionality reduction, explaining:
- Goal and possible applications of the model
- Formulation of the model, including also the training objective and its solution
- The characteristics of the PCA components 
- How the model can be employed in classification tasks

Describe the Linear Disciminant Analysis (LDA) approach for classification and dimensionality reduction, explaining:
- Gaol and possible applications of the model
- Formulation of the model, including also the training objective and its solution, for both binary and multiclass tasks
- How the model can be employed for classification tasks
